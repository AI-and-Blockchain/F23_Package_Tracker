## About
<div align="center">
<h3 align="center">Package Tracker</h3>
<p>
The Package Tracker introduces faster and safer standards of delivery for cities and local populations. Users may sign up to deliver for us, from which theyâ€™ll receive instant payment for successful delivery. Packages are brought from a distribution center and delivered to a local parcel locker. Each package has a unique identifier to be scanned in at each point of the process. Receiving users are given real-time updates on the status of their package, as well as optimized route planning. 

</P>

## Blockchain Component

<p>
QR code creation: We will be required to generate three separate QR codes to call different functions of the smart contract in order to facilitate communication and delivery of information between the three parties: sender, receiver, and courier.

The generation of the QR codes can be done using the following plug-in: https://github.com/jibrelnetwork/ethereum-qr-code/blob/master/README.md

Functions to update state variables, and send status updates such as expected ETA will be created so that the receiver can be aware of the current status of the delivery.

Events can be used to create a log and keep track of the various steps involved from start to finish.
</P>
